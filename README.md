## Description

### Abstract

In this paper, a truly explicit time marching procedure for solving the non-hydrostatic shallow water 
13 equation (SWE) problems is proposed. The procedure includes a process of prediction and several 
iterations of 14 corrections. In these processes, it is significant to accurately calculate the spatial 
derives of the physical quantities 15 such as the temporal water depth, the average velocities in the 
horizontal and vertical directions, and the dynamic 16 pressure at the bottom. 
The weighted-least-squares (WLS) meshless method is employed to calculate these spatial 17 derivatives. 
Though the non-hydrostatic shallow water equations are two dimensional, on the focus of presenting 18 
this brand new time marching approach, we just use one dimensional benchmark problems to validate the 
stability 19 and accuracy of the present model. Good agreement can be found in the comparing the present 
numerical results 20 with analytic solutions, experiment data, or other numerical results.
