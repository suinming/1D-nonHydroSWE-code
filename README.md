## Description

### Motivation

    A truly explicit time marching procedure for solving the 
    non-hydrostatic shallow water equation (SWE) problems is 
    proposed. The procedure includes a process of prediction 
    and several iterations of corrections. 
    
    In these processes, it is significant to accurately calculate 
    the spatial derives of the physical quantities such as the 
    temporal water depth, the average velocities in the horizontal 
    and vertical directions, and the dynamic pressure at the bottom. 
    
    The weighted-least-squares (WLS) meshless method is employed 
    to calculate these spatial derivatives. Though the non-hydrostatic 
    shallow water equations are two dimensional, on the focus of 
    presenting  this brand new time marching approach, we just use 
    one dimensional benchmark problems to validate the stability and 
    accuracy of the present model. Good agreement can be found in the 
    comparing the present numerical results with analytic solutions, 
    experiment data, or other numerical results.
